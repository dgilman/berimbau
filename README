berimbau is a web-based file browser.  The idea is that you've got these files
and you want to share them with your friends, so you point berimbau at some
directories and you serve it from there.

Cool features:

- Python3 (3.4 required, it uses the new pathlib module)
- Queries for current bandwidth usage and displays that on each page.
   This might seem like a weird feature, but it can give your friends a good
   idea of how much bandwidth is being used
- The front page has a 'newest files' which is updated on the fly as they
   are added/removed from the filesystem
- Logs accesses/downloads done by each user and has an OK interface for
   browsing that.  I know it's redundant on most servers, but I wanted it.
- Used to support xsendfile but I turned it off because it's broken on mac


Requirements:
- Python 3.4
- MacOS X: ifbw.py uses a BSD syscall.  It's possible to factor this out and
   make it multi-platform, patches welcome.
   fs.py also makes use of the MacFSEvents python module which is mac-only.
- flask

Installation:
1. Get a wsgi server working.  I used apache 2.4 and mod_wsgi.
1a. Test it with a tiny wsgi app just to be sure apache is working with your
      venv.
2. Check out the repo, set up a venv, install modules
3. Patch platform-specific code if necessary
4. app.wsgi.example is an example WSGI app that sets up the proper virtualenv
   stuff, you'll want to edit it for your configuration and point your web
   server at it
5. config.py.example shows how to set up the configuration file
